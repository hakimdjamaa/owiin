Owiin is a EAM program project (Enterprise Asset Management) derived from specific and extensive experience in the field, following the rules and best practice.

Owiin is at the same time a ready-to-use standard product, and a solution that can be custom-configured through provided mechanisms that allow to work on every system element (data models, workflows, reports, dashboards, connectors, etc.).

Owiin is based on the iDempiere Business Suite from which it inherits the basic functionalities and the configuration mechanisms.
